## Welcome to Project Coorg 

### About Us

In the early September of 2018, the earth beneath Kodagu trembled, defacing parts of what were previously the glorious, silent hills of the Western Ghats. These were not earthquakes but landslides, where massive chunks of hills on which whole lives and livelihoods were built, came crashing down destroying everything in its path. People lost their homes, estates, valuable properties, documents, cattle, pets and some even their lives.  In the wake of this disaster, a few us residents of this district have decided to come together and join hands in tackling the aftermath of the same.

We are constituted by members from various backgrounds, including businessmen, financiers, planters, educators, lawyers and social workers who were born and raised, and have lived in Kodagu. We aim to understand the socio-ecological causes and effects of this disaster. We intend to undertake activities that will help mitigate the damage, educate the locals on sustainable livelihood practices, and to help rebuild the society and economy of Coorg.



### Objectives
